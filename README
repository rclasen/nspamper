nspamper
========

nspamper is a client that takes care of updating a dynamic DNS name
using Bind9 NSupdates. The client has two parts:

 - The nspamper daemon performing the actual update. Once it's told your
   current IP it retries updating the entry until it sees the new IP
   through DNS. It listens on a unix socket to learn about your current
   IP.

 - nspamper-change connects to this unix socket and informs the nspamper
   daemon about your current IP. Usually it's called from pppd's ip-up
   script with $PPP_LOCAL whenever your link comes up. Other ideas are
   dhclient scripts or something run from cron to poll ifconfig output
   (*urgs*).

There are also some samples for the server side:

 - ddns is the quick'n'dirty script to generate the tsig keys and build an
   include file with the keys for named (/etc/bind/ddns-keys.conf). It's
   cofig is stored in /etc/bind/ddns.conf. For now you have to RTFS ...

 - dyn2nsup is a cgi I use to translate dyndns.org updates to nsupdates.
   This is helpful if you can't install the nspamper client (appliances,
   windows, ...). Unfortunatly you have to setup extra users for HTTP
   authentication (.htpasswd and friends) and put the usernames into the
   config generated by 'ddns', manually.

 - named.example, zone.example shows a sample to configure your bind9 for
   this.


To install this module type the following:

 - build and install the programs:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

 - copy the sample config to /etc

   cp nspamper.conf /etc/
   vi /etc/nspamper.conf # adjust hostname + tsig key

 - ensure the daemon starts. Run "nspamper" from rc.local or adjust
   debian/init to your needs.

 - find a method to call "nspamper-change $ip" whenever your ip changes
   (pppd ip-up script, dhclient script, ...)
