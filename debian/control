Description:  daemon to update dynamic DNS names
 This is a bind9 nsupdate client to keep a dynamic A record up to date
 .
 Changes must be triggered by writing the new IP to a socket/FIFO.
 .
 This daemon will retry to send the update until the Nameserver returns the
 proper IP.
 .
 Once the update was successfull, this script assumes, the server won't
 forget the IP and therefor sleeps until the IP is changed again.
 .
 This has to run as daemon, to avoid problems with overlapping requests. That means it gracefully accepts a new IP although the current one wasn't accepted by the nameserver.
